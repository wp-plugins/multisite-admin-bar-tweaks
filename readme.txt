*Depreciated* Adds several useful links to the Multisite "Network Admin" admin bar.

== Description ==

*This plugin is no longer under active development or support.* There are [several](http://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-toolbar-additions/) [other](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/custom-admin-bar/) admin bar plugins that provide this functionality and more.

As a Multisite administrator & developer, what's the one task you most often need to accomplish from within the Network Admin section?...Manage plugins! Am I right?  This plugin adds the network 'Plugins' and 'Install Plugin' links to 'My Sites' > 'Network Admin' in the site admin bar. 


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `multisite-admin-bar-tweaks` folder to your site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Network Admin' > 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That's it!

Hence, it won't do anything if you're not running [Multisite](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network "How to create a multisite network").
